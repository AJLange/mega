    A type of object that, when entered, contains a 
    grid of rooms.

    a city has a persistent attribute called entry-room
    which indicates where you go when you walk in.
    we set this to a default then change it when
    making the city.

class FactionBase(City):
    '''
    A type of city that can be infiltrated.
    Infiltration commands are, however, TBD,
    so for right now, this works just like
    any other city location.

class Warship(FactionBase):
    '''
    A type of object that, when entered, contains a 
    grid of rooms, but is also mobile from room to room.

    Basically, a warship is a type of mobile city.
    Warships contain all commands for faction bases as well since
    they will never not belong to someone.

class PersonalRoom(Object):
    '''
    A personal Room is an object created by a player.
    Entering a personal room teleports the player to
    a single room on the grid which is their dedicated
    personal quarters room. 
    Personal Rooms can be picked up, moved, and re-desced.

    '''
    A Stage is an object that, when entered, still broadcasts to 
    the room that it's in, but appends its name to the front of
    the pose.

class Vehicle(Stage):
    '''
    A vehicle is a type of Stage.
    The difference between a vehicle and an ordinary Stage
    is that a vehicle can be moved around from the inside via
    a series of driving commands.

    Doesn't work now. May not get used. Leaving it here anyway.
