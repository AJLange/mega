    +group <name> will only function on groups of which you are a member.
    
    This will list insider info about the group such as radio frequencies and 
    message of the day.

    If a group has squads, +group <name> will list those squads. If a group 
    does not have squads (smaller groups) +group <name> will list members.

    To see members of a squad in larger groups, use +group/squad group/name
    Example: +group/squad Robot Masters/Beta

    +group/info on the other hand lists basic information about a group and
    is useful if you need a help file explaining the purpose of a group. 
    It is available for all groups.

    +teams is an alias of +group. It has the same functionality, for those
